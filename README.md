👋 **Hi there**,
- My name is Ehizojie, i'm a passionate Digital Content and Product Specialist with 7+ years of experience in Digital Content Strategy, Media Operations, and Digital Product Management. I'm adept at leading content development, managing online communities,
   and bridging the divide between stakeholders in the software development lifecycle. I'm experienced in conducting user research, documentation, usability testing, A/B testing, rapid prototyping, product roadmaps, business cases studies, performance monitoring and analytics
   with a deep understanding of the SaaS environment.

- 🌱I’m currently learning and exploring DevOps practices and such frameworks like Python to further enhance my impact and contributions to any project or organization I find myself in.
- 👀 I love to contribute to open source software projects because it gives the opportunity to do work collaboratively while also making the applications better and more efficient. Open source also allows developers to redistribute and modify code under a specific license, which is also a major advantage. Contributing to open source software gives a sense of satisfaction and also enhances skills, which is a major advantage.
- 💞️ I’m looking to help with open source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-mid level opportunities.
- 💼 Job interests: Product Specialist, Product Manager, Product Research Analyst, Technical Content Writer (Intern or Junior level; freelance, contract or full-time).
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/HIm
- ⚡ Fun fact: Alumni of **Alshool Africa's School of Product**, Class of 2024
